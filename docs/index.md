# Introduction

River estuaries are transition zones between freshwater and marine ecosystems.
They provide essential habitat for both resident and migratory species.  Salmon, lamprey, and other species need to access streams and floodplains that are vital for their foraging, spawning, refuge, and rest.

For more than 100 years residents of the Oregon coast have created tide gates, levees, and other barriers to help control the tide and protect farm land, roads, building, and other infrastructure.  Many of the tide gates are failing and should be replaced with modern designs that meet current fish passage regulations.

The Nature Conservancy has developed a decision support system named the [**Tide Gate Optimization Tool**](https://oregontidegates.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Oregons-Tide-Gate-Optimization-Tool-Supporting-Decisions-to-Benefit-Nature-and-People.pdf) to help landowners and other stakeholders balance the potential gain and costs.
The goal is to help users identify "the best bang for the buck": given a set of budget levels, which set of barriers will provide the most benefit for each budget?
