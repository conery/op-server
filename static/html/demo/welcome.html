    Migratory fish may encounter several man-made barriers during their journey.
    Tide gates, levees, culverts, and other infrastructure makes it difficult for fish to access vital habitat for foraging, spawning, and resting.
</p>
<p>
    Aging barriers often need to be updated or replaced.
    Since improving barriers is very costly, stakeholders need to decide how to allocate funds in a way that maximizes improvements.
    <em>OptiPass&trade;</em>, an application developed by Dr. Jesse O'Hanley of Ecotelligence&reg; LLC, is a software tool that models the important attributes of barriers -- location, cost to repair, and expected benefits after repair -- and idenfifies the optimal set of barriers for any specified budget.
</p>
<p>
    OptiPass runs only on Microsoft Windows&reg systems.  
    In order to make it easier to deploy applications that want to use OptiPass a project led by The Nature Conservancy has developed two web applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> 
        A server, named <em><code>op-server</code></em>, is a RESTful web service that provides an interface to OptiPass.
    </li>
    <li>
        A client, named <em><code>op-client</code></em>, is a web application that displays an interface that allows users to select runtime options (select barriers, specify budget levels, <it>etc.</it>) and then pass those optioms to the server to have it run OptiPass.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    What are looking at now is an instance of the client.
    It is configured to connect to a server that has example data from the OptiPass User Manual.
</p>
<p>
    Click the <b>Help</b> tab above to learn how the interface is organized and how to define parameters for an optimization.
</p>
<p>
    When you are ready to run the optimizer click on the <b>Start</b> tab.
</p>
<p>
    When the OptiPass server returns the results from an optimization they can be viewed in the <b>Output</b> tab.  The <b>Download</b> tab will have options for saving results.

    <code>op-server</code> is written in Python, using the FastAPI library.
    The code is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/conery/op-server">https://github.com/conery/op-server</a>.
    The documentation at <a href="https://conery.github.io/op-server">https://conery.github.io/op-server</a> explains how to install the server (which must be run on a Microsoft Windows host) and configure it to serve data from a real river system.
</p>
<p>
    <code>op-client</code> is also written in Python, using the Panel library to present the GUI.
    The code is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/conery/op-client">https://github.com/conery/op-client</a>.
    The documentation at <a href="https://conery.github.io/op-client">https://conery.github.io/op-client</a> explains how to install and configure the server.
</p>
<p>
    (TBD) The client will also be available as a Docker image at ...
